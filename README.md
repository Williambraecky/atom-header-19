# header-19 package

An atom package to add the 19 header to your files.

This is just a basic fork of (https://github.com/Kerollmops/atom-header-42) to replace *.42.fr with *.s19.be

You can trigger it with the `cmd-alt-h` shortcut.

supported header formats are:
`#`, `/* */`, `<!-- -->`, `[[ ]]`, `(* *)`, `{- -}`, `;`
